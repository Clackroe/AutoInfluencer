1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
It was a dark and stormy night

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,240
It looked like something out of a horror movie

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,264
Crumbling

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Broken shut

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
As he opened the door

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
His heart pounded in anticipation

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,576
He could feel the tension in the air as he stepped into the hallways filled with strange objects

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
Text that seem to have a life of Their Own

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Everywhere he looked

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
There were strange shadows and unfamiliar

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
This is coming from every corner of

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
The more Robert explored this Gloomy building

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
The more convinced he became

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Best place held a dark secret

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Next

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Peculiar smell coming from inside

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,712
But it was in the back room where his real curiosity was sat

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Hidden under stacks of books and ancient artifact

19
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Robert was horrified as he read through these

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Hysteria due to Superstition surrounding

21
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
Thousands of people believe they were cursed by

22
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,104
This is beyond their control and began accusing others of black magic and devil worship before these

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
Accusations eventually led to

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
At first Robert thought this was just

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,416
Ghostly activities in the antique

26
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Suddenly it all

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
This shop served as an unintentional conduit

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Creating waves of mass Hysteria
