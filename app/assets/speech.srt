1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,072
It All Began on the grand opening of the top-rated Hotel the

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:03,840
The prominence

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,656
It was brand new modern and luxurious

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:11,776
The type of place where guests could get away from their everyday lives and Retreat into a world of Blitz and glamour

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
The management prided themselves on the rigorous standards of customer service and always tried to keep their employees satisfied as well

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
Little did they know beneath the shiny veneer

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,064
Secret

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
The prominence had to offer

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,000
Amy had recently been hired for her first shift at the hotel's front desk

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
And she was beyond excited

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
This was her big break

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,376
She had no idea it would also be her last

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
On her way home after work one night

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,264
Play Amy stopped by an antique store just to browse through some old items

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
Then something caught her

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
A porcelain doll with deep green eyes that seem to follow her every move

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
Without thinking twice

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
She paid for it and brought it back to her tiny little apartment

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Little did she know

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
Cursing them with unimaginable nightmares every night

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
And So It Be

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Every night at Sun

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Amy would wake up in a cold sweat covered in dirt and scratch

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,496
What's 9 * 4.00

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
It had become obvious that these figures were being controlled by the

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
At first

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
Is Amy thought it was all in her head

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,248
Until one night when she got home late after working a double shift at the hotel

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
As if an invisible hand was turning on every light source possible

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Her alarm clock

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Television

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Even her phone

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
On top of that

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
Before disappearing quickly down the drain

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Amy was terrified

36
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
This was too much Beyond any logical

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Explanation

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
She realized then that something Supernatural was at play here and sought help from an ex

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
After much confusion and disgust

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Missions with the prominences

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,088
Amy told them and take appropriate action

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Directions to rid the doll of its

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
At

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,232
Peace and calmness resumed in darkness and Gulf the hotel once more

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
The truth is now known

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,864
Bill employees may be oblivious to what lurks in the shadows

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
The prominence Hotel

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
Management now knows better than ever what kind of things not to allow in the hotel premises
